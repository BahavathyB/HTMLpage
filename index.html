<h1>Git and Github</h1>
<p>Git is a free, open-source distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files, especially code. It's the most popular VCS and is considered the de facto standard tool for software development. Essentially, Git allows developers to collaborate efficiently on projects, manage different versions of code, and revert to older states if needed</p>
